## 📖 About The Project

**Country Trivia CLI** is a simple yet engaging trivia game built with Python. It's designed to challenge your geography skills by asking you to guess the capital of a given country or the country of a given capital. The project uses a local SQLite database to store and retrieve trivia data, making it fast and efficient.

This project was created as a fun way to practice Python fundamentals, file handling, and database interaction.

**Tech Stack:**

- **Python**
- **SQLite** for data storage
- **Pandas** for data handling

---

## ✨ Features

- **Two Game Modes:** Guess the capital city or guess the country.
- **Randomized Questions:** The trivia questions are shuffled for a new experience every time.
- **Simple CLI:** Easy-to-use and intuitive command-line interface.
- **Score Tracking:** (As seen in `player_data.py`) The structure is in place to easily add player and score tracking functionality.

## 🧠 Data Structures & Algorithms

This project utilizes fundamental concepts of data structures and algorithms to function effectively.

- **Data Structure: Hash Map (Dictionary)**

  - In the `modules/player_data.py` file, the `Scoreboard` class uses a Python dictionary (`self.players`) to store `Player` objects.
  - **Why it's good:** Using a dictionary provides an efficient way to manage player data. It allows for **O(1)** or constant time complexity on average for adding new players (`add_player`), retrieving a player's score (`get_player_score`), and updating scores (`add_score`), as it uses the player's name as a unique key.

- **Algorithm: Random Sampling**

  - The `shuffle_pack` function in `modules/game_functions.py` uses `random.sample(country_data, len(country_data))`.
  - **Why it's good:** This is an efficient way to create a shuffled copy of the country data list for each new game, ensuring that the order of questions is random and unpredictable for the user.

## ⚠️ Archived Project

This CLI application is **no longer in active development**, and no new features will be added. The project is being continuously developed as a full-stack web application.

## 🛠️ Known Issues

- Answers require exact matches, including spacing and capitalization.
- "Saint" must be fully spelled out (e.g., "Saint John's").
- Only "Pretoria" is accepted as the capital of South Africa.
- Some capitals, like Kingston, are shared by multiple territories (Jamaica & Norfolk Island), which can lead to ambiguity.
